# PDA Order Management System (Qt GUI)

This is a simple graphical order management application designed for use in restaurants, cafes, or similar businesses.  
It was developed as part of a university assignment, using C++ and the Qt framework for the graphical user interface.

The application simulates a basic PDA (handheld device) used by waiters to take orders from different tables and send them to the kitchen. It provides an intuitive GUI, making the order-taking process fast and efficient.  
While the project is simplified for educational purposes, it demonstrates the structure of a real-world restaurant ordering system.
